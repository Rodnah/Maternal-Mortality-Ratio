### Project Overview
This project investigates maternal mortality ratios over two decades, highlighting the direct impact of socioeconomic conditions, such as the Human Development Index (HDI), on the global scale.

### Data Sources
The primary dataset was downloaded from [data.world](https://data.world/) as a CSV file. This CSV contains detailed information about various parameters within the dataset.

### Tools
1. Excel - Data Cleaning and Preprocessing
2. Tableau - [Data Visualization](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/aminah.atobiloye/viz/GlobalMaternalMortalityRatio_17082411744680/Dashboard1)

### Data Cleaning
In the initial data preparation phase, I performed the following tasks:
1. Data loading and inspection.
2. Handling missing values.
3. Data cleaning and formatting.

### Exploratory Data Analysis
EDA involved exploring the data to answer critical questions, such as:
1. What is the average HDI distribution acrossss continents?
2. How does the average maternal mortality ratio differ per continent?
3. What's the global average prevalence of maternal mortality? 
4. Does the average maternal mortality rate change across these two decades? 


### Results
The analysis results are summarized as follows:

1. Africa had the highest average HDI ratio, while Europe had the lowest.
2. The average maternal mortality ratio (AMMR) is directly correlated with HDI rank, with Africa and Europe reporting the highest and lowest AMMRs, respectively.
3. Across the two decades, there was a consistent decrease in the average maternal mortality rate, indicating positive progress in maternal healthcare globally.



### Recommendations
Based on the analysis, I recommend the following actions:
1. Target interventions in regions with high maternal mortality, particularly in Africa, to enhance healthcare access and quality.
2. Address socio-economic disparities by prioritizing initiatives to improve HDI rankings, thereby reducing maternal mortality rates.
3. Continuously monitor and enhance maternal healthcare programs worldwide to maintain progress in reducing maternal mortality.
